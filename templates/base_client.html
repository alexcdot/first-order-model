            <h1>MIND-JACK THE PRESIDENT</h1>
            <p>Welcome to the Chief Scientist's Lab. Here, we've been developing a technology that the FBC was able to build, and that the public cannot begin to imagine. <b>Wireless mind-jacks.</b> Our recent discovery of the ability for 5G to transmit and spread mind-viruses has enabled us to take control of other people's minds without them even knowing. <b>Please be responsbile with the use of this dangerous technology</b> <a href="https://github.com/alexcdot/first-order-model">(Although you can find the source code for this web app here)</a>!
                <br><br>
            Our plan is to expose Project Hyperskelion for what it is by getting the President to deliver our message on live television, but before that, we will do a bit of practice to make sure reporters find us authentic. To get started, just upload the image of someone you'd like to control (or not, and use the default image), and then a driving video of yourself saying the things you want them to say.

                <p><b>Make sure your video is turned off on Zoom! When recording, make sure your face is well lit and fills the green oval! It's preferable if you have uncluttered, uniform background as well.</b> Note: Recording is not supported on iOS or Internet Explorer, but you can upload your own selfie/webcam videos. Once you are done recording, you must <b>download to get your driving video, and upload it before running mind control.</b>

            <p>By default, we use a source image of bionically-enhanced Trump and a driving video from Donald Trump in the past. If you hit the "Upload" button without uploading any files, you will see this this example video.
